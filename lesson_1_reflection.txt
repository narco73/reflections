How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It showed which lines had changes

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It would make errors in changed easier to find

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    well if it was manual you'd know when the error started, but you'd also have to remember to commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because programmers use more than one file at a time

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log will show a list of all commits. Diff will show the differences between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You know you can go back to a previous version, should any issues come up

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    The same I've always used it for.
